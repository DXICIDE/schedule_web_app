Weekly/daily Schedule web app

1.5
This is an unfinished project that has been pospoted because I really dont have the time to mingle in js and html, I shall return when I'll have more time
but it has been a great experience so far, I have learned a lot about sql, database connecting to website, css grids, liveserver etc.
The furthrest I've gotten was all my database entries showing on the website but converting it to a time grind would be really time exhausting.
So lets just call this project fuctional database for website and call it a day.
To reflect on the project. Flask was a great choice, I kinda like it. easy and fun to use. Almost made me bald when I tried to make autorefresh work.
I then switched to liveserver.
sqlite3 was also quite good to use. It was really easy connecting the python class with the database. Maybe didnt need to go so overkill on this, but if I wanted to expand on the project, It would be very easy to do. Dont regret that decision one bit.
welp, thats all from me. Hello my future self, enjoy.
